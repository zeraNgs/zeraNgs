Installation part for powercord is 

Installing Powercord
Prerequisites
git ‚Äì https://git-scm.com/downloads
node and npm (v10.0.0 or later; LTS is recommended*) ‚Äì https://nodejs.org
Discord Canary (Powercord will only work with Canary!)
macOS: https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx
Windows: https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=win
Linux (deb): https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux
Linux (tar.gz): https://discord.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux&format=tar.gz
Note: You cannot have both Powercord and another client mod injected at the same time. If you have one installed, you must first uninstall it from your Discord Canary installation before proceeding to installation.

Installation
Here we will assume that you have correctly installed ‚ÄòGit‚Äô and ‚ÄòNode‚Äô and are using ‚ÄòDiscord Canary‚Äô. It is also worth mentioning that if you are on Linux, we highly recommend that you leave Discord Canary running while going through Steps 1 and 2.

Open a command prompt / terminal of your choice (e.g. CMD if you‚Äôre on Windows, or Terminal if you‚Äôre using Linux / macOS) - Windows users: please do NOT select ‚ÄúRun as an Administrator‚Äù as Powercord will fail to inject if you do so.
In chronological order, type each of these commands into the same command prompt / terminal opened in Step 1:
git clone https://github.com/powercord-org/powercord
cd powercord
npm i
npm run plug (Linux users: you‚Äôll need to run this command with sudo)
Completely ‚Äúkill‚Äù your Discord Client (right-click in the System Tray -> ‚ÄúQuit DiscordCanary‚Äù).
Start Discord back up and Powercord should be injected!
Uninstallation
Open a command prompt / terminal of your choice.
Navigate to your existing Powercord installation (e.g. cd powercord).
Type npm run unplug (Linux users: you‚Äôll need to run this command with sudo)
Completely ‚Äúkill‚Äù your Discord Client (right-click in the System Tray -> ‚ÄúQuit DiscordCanary‚Äù).
Start Discord back up and Powercord should no longer be injected.
IMPORTANT: Make sure to do this BEFORE deleting Powercord's files, or else you‚Äôll risk ending up with a corrupted Discord installation!

Walkthrough
The following preview shows how to install Powercord on a Windows device. However, the installation process remains similar, if not the same on other platforms.
